# Bald-Rubi_Chan 🎯


## Find Baldness of Head using opencv

### Project Description
Baldness Detector is a playful computer vision project that uses deep learning and facial segmentation to estimate scalp coverage in real time. Whether you're flaunting a full mane or embracing the bald boss lifestyle, this tool gives you instant feedback — no judgment, just follicles.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world overflowing with existential crises, climate change, and AI ethics, one issue has somehow slipped through the cracks: spontaneous baldness awareness. Millions walk the streets unaware of their follicular fate. Is that a receding hairline or just bad lighting? Is your crown thinning or is it just the wind? Society has failed to provide real-time, pixel-perfect answers.
No one asked, but we saw the void. And we filled it with scalp segmentation.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing Baldness Detector — the unsolicited hero of hair diagnostics. Using cutting-edge deep learning and facial geometry, it delivers instant follicle feedback whether you want it or not. It’s the kind of solution that makes you say, “Why does this exist?” and then, “Wait… show me again.”
Because sometimes, the best innovations are the ones nobody needed, but everyone ends up using at 2 AM with their friends.
